# COOL C# Journey 

> **Did you know?**
> The name "Cool" is a tribute to the original code name of C# inside Microsoft in 2000, which stood for **"C-like Object Oriented Language"**. This repository documents my journey in mastering it.

## Projects

### 01 - Grade System (Console App)
A robust grade calculation tool that focuses on clean code principles, strict input validation, and modern C# syntax.

**Key Concepts Applied:**
- **Modern Switch Expressions:** Using C# 8.0+ syntax for cleaner logic flow.
- **Pattern Matching:** Implementing logical patterns (e.g., `> 100 or < 0`) directly within switch statements.
- **Defensive Programming:** Using `int.TryParse` to prevent runtime crashes from invalid user inputs.
- **String Manipulation:** utilizing `Split` with `StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries` to handle edge cases like extra whitespace.
- **Control Flow:** Efficient use of `foreach` loops and conditional breaks.
